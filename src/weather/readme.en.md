### How do I find developer information

Login your [Dev.QWeather](https://dev.qweather.com/) account, click on the top on the right side of the "Console", then choose "Project" on the left. Click the "Create Project" button, enter the project name, select the subscription method, personally recommend choosing a free subscription, but there is a limit of requests per day, then select "Web API", and finally create your project.

Once the project is created, click "View" under the table "KEY" on the "Project" page to see the KEY you need.
